    "\n",
    "*Bottleneck: Many social scientists access programs and files by using a mouse to navigate a graphical user interface.  Shifting from a point-and-click workflow to a text-based workflow can be a difficult transition for new Python programmers.  For a more detailed discussion, see Kieran Healy's [The Plain Person's Guide to Plain-Text Social Science](http://plain-text.co).*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Interpreter for Conversing in Python\n",
    "The Python **interpreter** is an interface between you and the underlying software that translates and responds to your Python commands.  When using the interpreter, you type Python commands directly into a console (windwo) and the console displays a response.  You may see  people refer to an interpreter as an **interactive shell** or a **REPL** (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop).  You can install Python, which comes with the interpreter, from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Editor for Writing Programs\n",
    "A text editor is a tool that you can use to write commands in plain, unprocessed text.  All operating systems include a basic text editor, such as NotePad or TextEdit.  Social scientists using Python and other programming languages can use a text editor to store a set of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command Line Interface for Interacting with Your OS\n",
    "Every operating system has a special interpreter that allows the programmer to interact with the system through text-based commands.  The **command line interface** can be used to access any programs or files available to the programmer. This text-based approach is generally more flexible and more powerful than using . \n",
    "\n",
    "### _Mise En Place_: Integrated Development Environments\n",
    "Software that combines an interpreter, text editor, and command line into an easily navigable user interface is called an **integrated development environment (IDE)**.  An IDE might also include additional tools such as a file browser or version control integration. If you install Python using installers from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/), the installation will include a basic IDE called IDLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda) is a data science plaform that you can [download](https://www.continuum.io/) from Continuum Analytics.  Anaconda bundles Python with an IDE called Spyder and several popular Python libraries.  Anaconda is useful because it provides several tools that data scientists would otherwise need to install and configure individually.  It also provides a graphical user interface for programmers who are less familiar or less comfortable using the command line.  However, Anaconda can be confusing to beginners who are learning Python and would benefit from a general understanding of how the most basic components of a development environment fit together.  "

Web-based resources tend to fall along a spectrum, based on their authors' intended audience.  At one end of the spectrum are _true beginner_ tutorials, which cover the basic syntax and structure of a given programming language.  The programmer learns how to write very basic programs, but she isn't equipped to actually use it in her workflow without further guidance on identifying the appropriate tools and using the command line interface to install, manage, and perform tasks with the language.  At the other end of the spectrum are _advanced programmer_ tutorials and a host of other resources, such as software documentation, blog posts, and worked examples.  These resources tend to target programmers who already have a text-based workflow and in many cases experience with a different programming language.  The programmer can find this information easily on the web, but she then wastes valuable time deciphering all the technical jargon.*"

    "\n",
    "Data structures are containers of data that are organized, formatted, and stored in a specific way.  In Python, data structures are also considered data types and referred to as **sequences**.  Examples of sequences include strings, lists, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A **string** is an ordered sequence of characters, such as `happy`.\n",
    " - A **list** is an ordered sequence of items, such as `['Leia', 'Rey', 'Maz']`.  A list is always contained within brackets, `[]` and Python allows you to create an empty list.  Python has another data structure called a **tuple**, which is contained within parentheses `()`.  Though lists and tuples are similar, the elements of a list can be modified and the elements of a tuple cannot be modified.  The technical term for structures that can be modified is *mutability*.  \n",

    "##### How To: Referencing Sequences\n",
    "Referencing the elements of a sequence depends on whether the sequence is *ordered* or *unordered*.  Elements within an ordered sequence are referenced by location.  Each item in the sequence has an index number, **starting with zero**.  Elements can also be referenced starting from the end of the sequence, using negative index numbers beginning with -1.  To access a range of elements, use the colon operator to retrieve the elements from the index to the left of the colon up to *but not including* the index to the right of the colon.  You can also omit an index to retrieve all the elements in that direction.\n",

    "Programming langues use logic to give the programmer control over how a program executes a command or set of commands.  Within Python, control structures are defined using **keywords**, **colons**, and **indentation**.  The code within a control structure must be indented by four spaces.  Many IDEs are configured to automatically indent the next line after a colon.  Programmers can also configure the Tab key on their keyboard to indent four spaces.  \n",

    "**Conditionals** are control structures that allow decision making within a program using the keywords **`if`**, **`elif`**, and **`else`**.  Python evaluates whether the logical statement after the keyword (e.g., `count >= 1`) is true and executes the commands within an indented block of code based on the result.  \n",

If `a` and `b` are integers, Python will return the sum of the two integers.  If `a` and `b` are strings, Python will return the concatenation of the two strings.  The `+` operator is **overloaded** because it uses one interface (`+`) to perform the same type of function on different data types.  Overloading is more efficient than creating separate interfaces for similar functionality, but its use requires more care on the part of the programmer.  \n",

These modules contain additional functions that you can use in your workflow.  As programming jargon goes, the terms **module**, **package**, and **library** have different meanings, but you'll often see them used interchangeably to represent Python functionality that comes from outside the base functionality.  Programmers can create their own libraries and publish them for use by others.  Python's programmer community, along with the numerous libraries available to the public, make it one of the most popular programming langues. \n",
